## **How I Started This Project Using Cursor**

As a developer constantly looking for efficient ways to speed up development, I recently started using **Cursor**, an AI-powered coding assistant, to help me streamline my backend projects. I wanted to build a **CRUD API for food profiles** using **FastAPI** while following **clean architecture principles**. Additionally, I needed **Docker support** to ensure smooth deployment and testing.

To track the development process, I recorded key timestamps and prompts, which I‚Äôll outline below.

## **Development Steps**

**üïí Start Time:** 4:05 PM

üìå **Bitbucket Repository:** [nutri-sim-be](https://github.com/tiukenywil11/nutri-sim-be)

### **Step 1: FastAPI CRUD Boilerplate with Clean Architecture**
Prompt:  
`Create a CRUD FastAPI boilerplate using clean architecture for food profile.`

Cursor quickly generated a **well-structured FastAPI boilerplate**, separating concerns with:  
‚úÖ **Routers** for API endpoints  
‚úÖ **Services** for business logic  
‚úÖ **Repositories** for database interactions  
‚úÖ **Schemas** using Pydantic models

---

### **Step 2: Dockerizing the Application**
Prompt:  
`Create Dockerfile and docker-compose file to make startup, testing, and deployment easier.`

To ensure **consistency across environments**, I needed **Docker support**. Cursor generated a **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yaml**, allowing me to:
- Build a lightweight FastAPI container
- Set up a **PostgreSQL** database service
- Easily spin up the entire stack with `docker-compose up`

### **Step 3: Fixing Postgres Version Incompatibility**
Prompt:  
`Can you fix the following errors? [Postgres version incompatibility error]`

I ran into a **Postgres version mismatch** between my local environment and the Docker container. Cursor helped me adjust the **PostgreSQL version** in `docker-compose.yaml` and modify environment variables to ensure compatibility.

### **Step 4: Debugging Internal Server Error (Database Issue)**
Prompt:  
`What does this error mean, can you fix it? [Internal server error, database issue]`

After running migrations, I encountered an **Internal Server Error** due to misconfigured database settings. Cursor identified the issue, suggesting:
- Updating **SQLAlchemy connection strings**
- Adjusting **Alembic migration settings**

After applying the fixes, database connections worked smoothly. üöÄ

### **Step 5: Creating a Postman Collection**
Prompt:  
`Create a Postman collection to test all endpoints.`

To simplify API testing, Cursor generated a **Postman collection** with:
- CRUD requests for the **food profile endpoints**
- Environment variables for API base URL
- Pre-configured authentication headers

This made testing much faster! ‚úÖ

### **Step 6: Fixing Type Errors in Food Profile Creation**
Prompt:  
`Can you fix this type error? [TypeError upon creating food]`

Upon testing, I encountered a **TypeError** due to incorrect data validation. Cursor helped:
- Adjust **Pydantic models** to properly parse input types
- Add **request validation handlers** to return clearer error messages

Once fixed, the API accepted and stored food profiles correctly. ü•ó

## **Final Outcome**

**üïí End Time:** 4:47 PM  
**Total Duration:** **42 minutes** ‚è≥

In just **under an hour**, I successfully:
‚úÖ Built a **FastAPI CRUD application** with clean architecture  
‚úÖ **Dockerized** the setup for easy deployment  
‚úÖ Resolved **database compatibility issues**  
‚úÖ Fixed **server errors and type validation bugs**  
‚úÖ Created a **Postman collection** for streamlined testing  

---

## **Conclusion**

Using **Cursor** significantly **accelerated my development process**, allowing me to build and debug a fully functional **FastAPI backend** in record time. Instead of manually fixing errors and writing boilerplate code, I could focus on **refining the architecture and improving performance**.

Stay tuned for more updates! üöÄ
