# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to start with the front-end and follow a Youtube tutorial from freeCodeCamp called "React Project Tutorial â€“ Build a Portfolio Website w/ Advanced Animations", the link can be found [here](https://youtu.be/bmpI252DmiI). I will customize the graphics later on to fit my preference.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this is that I prefer beginning with a template, to speed up my development time. It will take a long time to create a front-end UI and UX design. For me the quote "make it work, then make it good" applies here.  

# Steps
For this day I decided to just take it easy and create a base template, and to install the dependencies needed for the projects to work.
  
## Creating a base ReactJS template
1. Create a base react template by opening a command line, and inputting the following command:
```bash
npx create-react-app tiukenywil11_portfolio
```

2. Navigate to the project.
```bash
cd tiukenywil11_portfolio
```

3. Install the following dependencies.
- **emailjs**: Library to implement the contact form.
```bash
npm i @emailjs/browser
```
- **fortawesome**: Library to get free icons.
```bash
npm i @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```
- **animate.css**: CSS library to animate objects and fonts
```bash
npm i animate.css
```
- **gsap-trial**: For advanced animations
```bash
npm i gsap-trial
```
- **loaders.css**: Package for loaders
```bash
npm i loaders.css
```
- **react-leaflet**: Library for maps
```bash
npm i react-leaflet
```
- **react-loaders**: Loaders with react integrations
```bash
npm i react-loaders
```
- **react-router-dom**: Standard ReactJS package for routing
```bash
npm i react-router-dom
```
- **sass**: A CSS extension language.
```bash
npm i sass
```

4. Test if ReactJS app is still working.
```bash
npm start
```

# Outro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the progress I have made today, the changes can be found in my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/tiukenywil11/decentralized-portfolio/commit/12fcd5293687b3bb344491e5b2af8329350c2ef1).
