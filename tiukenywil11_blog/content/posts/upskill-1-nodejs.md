# Introduction
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to do a deep dive on NodeJS. I already have  working knowledge by following a Youtube tutorial a few months ago, but I decided to take a closer look at what NodeJS has to offer. I will put links to my NodeJS Research on this blog post. These will be updated occassionally.
