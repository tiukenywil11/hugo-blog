# Introduction
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little background about myself. I have always been fond of creating websites, and having my own place or brand in the internet. I have developed front end UI and UX in the past using ReactJS, and Angular when they were just starting out. Most of my projects are kept in a private repository on Bitbucket, they are still there but at this point in time I have forgotten how to customize them (poor documentation on my part).  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My past projects made me focus more on the UI and UX aspect of my portfolio, manually customizing the html and css aspects of the page. I also loved experimenting the graphic part of web design including trying out different color combinations, typography, and some advance css like animations. Front end development alone is already a difficult part in developing websites.  
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with the boom of the Web3 buzzword I was thrilled with the idea of decentralization, and after some research I found out that majority of the technologies used have a heavy focus on the front end aspect of web development. Ideally the back end part of the application would be handled by blockchains and smart contracts. I was thrilled with upgrading my front end portfolio to migrate it to a decentralized format.  
  
# Idea
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My idea was to create a portfolio from scratch, but with a twist. Making an online portfolio is a not new, almost every web developer that are capable of developing can easily make their own page. Even people with less technical experience can create a portfolio using services such as WordPress nowadays.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the twist you're asking? Well this blog will focus on blockchain and smart contracts as much as possible so my idea was to make a Web3 version of a portfolio with decentralization aspects.  
  
## These are the tech stack I have in mind:
### Front end  
- Frontend: ReactJS (Javascript)
### Blockchain (Back end)
- Blockchain: Terra Luna or Solana Blockchain
- Smart Contract: Rust
### Hosting
- Server type: IPFS 
- Domain Name: Unstoppable Domain
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I alrady have a slight idea on how these things work together, but I would like to experiment and dive deep into these new technologies on a practical aspect. So I will be documenting my progress in this blog, and keeping a copy of the source code in my Github repository [here](https://github.com/tiukenywil11/decentralized-portfolio).
