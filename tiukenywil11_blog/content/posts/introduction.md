&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Kenywil Tiu, an aspiring blockchain developer with interest in learning innovative technologies. The intention of this blog is to share what I've been learning, and will be learning. This will also act as a journal for proof of concept mini projects, or full blown projects that I will be developing.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of now I have professional experience being a DevOps Engineer for 5 years. I also have a good understanding, and have programmed simple applications using programming languages such as Javascript, and Python. Lastly, I have been learning about blockchains and smart contracts, I can say that I have a good high level understanding of the concepts, and also have tried programming some myself.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The projects I aim to develop and learn will involve different types of blockchain, or smart contract applications. I have already developed some, and they can be found [here](https://github.com/tiukenywil11).
